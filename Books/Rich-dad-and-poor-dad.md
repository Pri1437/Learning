-   Life teaches you something when you are in an uncomfortable situation
    -   Thats when like pushes you to change and learn something.
    -   Life tells "Wake up your missing something I want you to understand that and learn".
-   Most people don't understand what to do when their situation gets tough
    -   Some quit and they give excuses
    -   Others push back or fight back but with their boss, or spouse not realising it's life pushing them to change.

-   Let go of fear, don't let fear of something take over the excitement of winning.
-   Take accountability of the situation and change yourself rather than wanting everything/everyone in the world to change.

    -   Energy
    -   Passion &rarr; anger + love for something

## Lesson 1: The Rich don't work for money<a id="sec-2-4" name="sec-2-4"></a>

### Avoiding One of Life's biggest traps<a id="sec-2-4-1" name="sec-2-4-1"></a>

-   Most people don't know what trap they are in.
-   Rich dad offered 25 cents an hour, then bumped it to dollar an hour and finally to 2 dollars, but what exactly was he trying to convey?
    -   There are two parts in a human
        -   One which is needy, greedy and which can be bought.
        -   One which is resilient and can't be bought.
    -   Every human has a price and that price was dictated with two emotions
        -   Fear &rarr; not having money motivates you to do the work.
        -   Greed &rarr; after getting the money you dream about what all to buy.
    -   If you observe there is a pattern that is generated, first because of fear your motivated to work and once you get the cash you desire stuff
    -   The cycle goes ****you get desperate work**** then ****get cash and spend**** this cycle goes on and on.
    -   Adding more money in this mix makes the cycle go longer.
        -   This cycle is consisting of fear and desire is the biggest trap in the world.
    -   The first step is to tell the truth about how your feeling.
    -   Most people think with emotions rather than their brain.
    -   Money controls people who are stuck in fear and emotion loop.
    -   Reasons people work for money
        -   Fear &rarr; they don't have the money for basic needs suppose
        -   Desire &rarr; they find happiness in buying things using money
            1.  This is often short lived because your craving for something till the time you get it. Once you get it the craving goes and becomes more.
    -   These people think that more money will solve their problems or quench their thirst of desire.
        -   Which is not true more money just increasing what they are feeling.
    -   It almost seems illogical to people who say they aren't interested in money but work for it anyway.
    -   Use your mind an emotions in your favour and not against yourself.
    -   Don't take decisions based on emotions like fear but take decisions with intention.
-   Main idea is ****Not to run around a paycheck****
-   If your deciding to work for a paycheck make sure ****you have other sources of income like assets, investment etc****
-   Ones's life is around ignorance or illumination.
    -   Once one stops thinking, searching for information, self-knowledge ignorance sets in.
-   Rich dad says that it is important for formal education to contribute to society
    -   Don't only develop your professional skills work on personal development as well.
-   Running around in life with fear only not exploring your dreams is cruel and is unfair to yourself
-   Now working hard for tangible goods that money buys thinking this will keep you happy is also cruel and unfair to yourself.
-   Example of a situation where one only thinks through emotions
    -   A person gets and up and runs to work, working hard fearing of not having money
    -   The person should stop and ask is working hard the best solution to the problem I have right now.
-   To break the emotional though cycle ask ****am I missing anything here?****
-   Rich dad says that money is an illusion and money is a concept that was created.
    -   Generally money or the paper we have is backed up by a tangible thing like gold or silver etc.
-   Q) What is the paper money that we think is real and we use it to buy stuff
    -   In olden days, people didn't have concept of money but rather barton system
    -   What is this concept of money?
    -   How is a piece of paper having some value and accepted for trading?

### Seeing what others don't see<a id="sec-2-4-2" name="sec-2-4-2"></a>

-   When you work for free your brain is no running after work that pays.
    -   You vision won't be limited to paycheck rather you will look at other options.
-   The kids were thinking about different ideas that they could come up but they stumbled upon a sight where they say mrs Martin was cutting a comic book.
-   They decided to open a library of comic books after they made a deal with comic book distributor.
-   They charged 10 cents per kid for two hours, they generated around 10 dollars a week for 3 months.
-   They understood the need for good staff where they were using Mike's younger sis as a incharge of library.
-   They had created a business that generated the money for them rather than they work for it.
