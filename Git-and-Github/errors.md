-   "fatal: not a git repository"
    $\\$
    This occurs when your using git but and use git command in a directory that is not a local repository (.git)
    $\\$
    Even if you have reached the repository if its not setup then git will throw you this error.
    -   _Fix_ is go to the local repository in gitbash/git or clone that repository into the desired location you want it again in.
    -   Git command runs on a specific repository
