What is Git?

Git is making my life so easy as it keeps all the versions of my files and tracks every changes.
_Git is wonderful_

Difference between a directory and repository?

Some extensions:

-   .git
-   .gitignore
-   .project
-   .DS_Store

Three areas in using git in local system:

-   Working dir
-   Staging area
-   .git directory (repo)
