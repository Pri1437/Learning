-   It is high level language

-   It is Statically type language

-   It is general purpose programming language

-   Class based and purely object-oriented

-   It has two-step process:
    -   Java source code → byte code (java complier does this)
    -   Byte code → respective machine level (done by Java Virtual machine (JVM))

-   JVM can :
    -   compile the byte code well in adv to native code(like c, c++)
    -   have JIT (just in time compilation)
    -   interpret the byte code
    -   directly run the byte code on the CPU

-   All objects are created in the heap
